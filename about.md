My name is **Alejandro Dustet**, and this is my website. I am a software
developer @ [thoughtbot]. I write mostly about challenges I encounter while
creating software. I have some opinions loosely held that I try to share via
this medium. Most of the content is on the [thoughtbot blog].


I want to thank [Hossain Mohd. Faysal](https://twitter.com/hmfaysal) for creating an awesome [template](http://hmfaysal.github.io/Notepad/) for jekyll.
